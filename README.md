### This is the homepage for the public summary of my MPhys project, Fourier accelerated lattice field theory.

This public summary is aimed at those people who have completed Higher (or equivalent) level physics and like to read the science section of their favourite news website.

Our current understanding of how fundamental particles interaction in our universe envisions them as being little excitations in "quantum fields" which permeate space and time. The figure below shows an impression of a field with a single peak (excitation) localized in space. This peak can be thought of as a particle.

There are two main ways to study these fields theoretically in order to investigate properties of these particles:
1. Blackboard calculations involving Feynman diagrams.
2. Simulate the fields on a computer (lattice field theory).

My project looked at the 2nd of these approaches which is particularly useful in certain cases (such as in the theory of _quantum chromodynamics_ which describes the physics of quarks, the constituents of protons and neutrons).

In order to get an idea of how we carry out lattice field simulations on a computer, let us first look at simulating something that can be visualized a little easier. Thus, we turn our attention to the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator. This is nothing much more than a system which will be quite familiar: a mass attached to a spring and allowed to oscillate back and forth. The quantum mechanics bit just means that the mass-spring system won't act quite as it is expected to in everyday life. 

Now, suppose you were to set up a frictionless table, and place on top of such a contraption consisting of a weight connected to a wall via a spring. You pull the mass away from its equilibrium point where it was stationary and let go. What you see is the motion below:
