### This is the homepage for the public summary of my MPhys project, Fourier accelerated lattice field theory.

This public summary is aimed at those people who have completed Higher (or equivalent) level physics and like to read the science section of their favourite news website.

Our current understanding of how fundamental particles interaction in our universe envisions them as being little excitations in "quantum fields" which permeate space and time. The figure below shows a few slices of a field which have

There are two main ways to study these fields theoretically in order to investigate properties of these particles:
1. Blackboard calculations involving Feynman diagrams.
2. Simulate the fields on a computer (lattice field theory).

My project looked
